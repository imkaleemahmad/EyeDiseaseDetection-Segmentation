# Early Detection of Eye Diseases Using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for Sclera Segmentation

This project leverages the **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** by Meta to segment the sclera in eye images, aiming to aid in the early diagnosis of eye diseases. Accurate sclera segmentation can play a crucial role in identifying ocular abnormalities at an early stage, potentially improving patient outcomes.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to use SAM for precise segmentation of the sclera, helping healthcare professionals and researchers to detect signs of eye diseases more efficiently. The system developed as part of this project can be integrated into broader diagnostic workflows, providing an additional tool for early detection and research.

### Key Features

- **Sclera Segmentation**: Uses SAM by Meta to identify and segment the sclera in eye images.
- **Early Disease Detection Support**: Offers potential to assist in identifying early symptoms of various eye conditions.
- **Image Processing Pipelines**: Includes preprocessing and postprocessing stages using various image processing libraries to enhance segmentation accuracy.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** by Meta
- **Image Processing Libraries**: Various libraries for image analysis, preprocessing, and segmentation, including but not limited to:
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - scikit-image
